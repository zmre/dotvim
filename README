Prologue:

Yes, its another vim configuration.  I've got mine parsed out into separate files for the most part and I'm posting to github largely so I can keep my various machines and logins synced up with the latest.  But anyone is welcome to take a look and comment, borrow, suggest improvements, etc.  I also have a vim cheeatsheet that I've linked into the dir that is specific to my shortcuts and setup.  It doesn't include the vim basics and stuff I don't need to reference, so your mileage may vary.

Installation:

    git clone git://github.com/zmre/dotvim.git ~/.vim

Create symlinks:

    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

Switch to the `~/.vim` directory, and fetch submodules:

    cd ~/.vim
    git submodule update --init

Note: some plugins will not work unless your vim has been built with python or ruby support.  Also, if you're not using vim 7.3, I recommend making every effort to get there.

The Command-T plugin requires you to build before you can use it on your platform.  See ~/.vim/bundle/command-t/README.txt for details, but the quick instructions are:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle/command-t
    rake make
